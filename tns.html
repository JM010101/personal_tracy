I am VERY disappointed in how network access is working out at SDSU. I
would even go as far as to say I am upset. I had a meeting with Joe
Vasquez recently. He was not at all helpful but my situation is now
becoming clear to me. 

I am sorry for this rather long email, but it explains how I feel and my 
position on this whole mess.

 The official reason for my ethernet being disconnected was because they:

 "...hadn't intended on people setting up servers where they could grant 
 access to people and basically circumvent the firewall."

                                -Rob Williams in a voicemail to me

This is absurd. Everyone at TNS must have known exactly what I was doing. 
It did not take them 3 months to figure out I was running a unix host.
Three TNS employees watched me boot it up, configure the networking stuff,
demonstrate UNIX, X, the whole bit. A short time later I applied for a
hostname so people could connect with my machine using the name
"straylight" instead of having to remember a bunch of weird numbers. Then
I applied for a firewall exception, which basically allows people from
outside the SDSU network to connect to my computer. A person would only do
these things if they were running a multi-user platform. If TNS had really
overlooked the fact that someone might run a server on the housing
network, I believe they were extremely negligent. 

I am a CS major. UNIX is a very big part of CS. A UNIX machine without a
network connection is of very little use. My whole motivation for
encouraging the ethernet project and moving into Toltec and getting the
ethernet was so I could run a multi-user (UNIX) system. I was working on
several programming projects with other people. Mainly network
programming. 

If my machine is firewalled I can initiate connections with other
computers, but they cannot do the same with my computer. This would limit
my ability to learn from others in the outside world. Almost all of the
accounts on my machine belong to SDSU students although some are for
students at other schools but they are extremely helpful in my field of
study. If my machine is firewalled I would not be able to program the
types of applications that I feel are necessary to develop strong job
related skills. I also would have to go through rohan to do my email. I am
not content to use a Mac/Windows machine and do only email and browse the
web like most people do. All of the other CS majors that I've told about
the ethernet in the halls want to do exactly what I have been doing.

During my meeting with Joe Vasquez I was told that there was a very long
list of requirements machines must meet in order to be a server on the
net. I have asked some people about this list and they have never heard of
it. I should have asked to see a copy of it. I mentioned that there are
people running servers on the network who have never heard of such a list
and he said something like "we're working on that." If they are going to
be consistent in their handling of this matter, they need to go over to
the engineering building and pull the plugs on all of those new servers
they've hooked up without even having heard of such a list. And how was it
that so many TNS employees knew I was setting up my pc like this and never
bothered to mention such a list? 

Then he mentioned liability. Who is liable if someone logs into my machine
and does something bad on the network? Me? The state? If I got sued, he
said (to paraphrase), "I've heard you're bright. I'd hate to see your
career ended before it even began." I do not give out accounts
indiscriminantly. Only to those who have a good reason for being on my
machine. He asked me if I knew what all of the people on my machine were
doing while they were logged in. I said yes. He asked again. I said yes.
He really pressed the issue. I continued saying yes, I know what these
people are doing and it is all legitimate. He just sat there and shook his
head. He said that I didn't know what they were doing. I think he is
implying that I cannot watch them every moment that they are using my
machine and that if they do something bad then I could be held liable, or
the state, and that is not acceptable. 

I feel it is acceptable. Who watches every user on rohan (the schools main
academic computer) every second of every day? Nobody. Is it just as easy
for a user to do something bad on rohan as it would be on my machine? 
Certainly. As the popularity of the Internet has grown, people have become
more and more worried about "hackers". SDSU is extremely reactionary about
its computer systems, to the point where people end up in the situation I
now find myself in. It's commonly known that the more secure a network is,
the less usable it is. This is especially true at SDSU. 

Joe Vasquez eventually let on to the *real* reason my ethernet was
disconnected. It seems there is a person who happens to be a friend of
mine who is very disliked by TNS who has an account on my machine.  This
person has somehow been linked to sending harassing email. When this
happened most of his accounts were locked and three weeks later he was
notified he should contact someone for an appointment to resolve the
matter. 

Seemingly there is no due process. No one calls to try and straighten
the matter out.  Instead  email is sent AFTER your service has been 
discontinued and you have no way of reading it.

This friend of mine who was linked to forging email had always had an
account on my machine, almost since the very first time I connected my
UNIX machine to the schools network over the modem using ppp. He was using
my machine to read mail, newsgroups, etc. while one of his rohan accounts
was suspended. THIS is the reason my machine was disconnected. 

Bob Clay said he did not want my friend on SDSU's network anymore but he
did not notify me of this until after my services were discontinued and as
far as I know my friend has never been notified of this. Infact, my friend
only recently recieved a letter from student affairs asking him to make an
appointment. 

The proper thing for them to do if they did not want him on my machine is
to contact me and tell me not to allow him access. I would have gladly
complied if it meant keeping my ethernet. Instead they completely
disconnected me and were not completely honest with me about why I was
disconnected. When someone sends an offensive email from rohan, do they
pull the plug on rohan? No, they act properly and email the administrator
and have the account disabled. To this day, nobody has asked me to remove
his account. 

Those of us who do things out of the ordinary, push the limits, go the
extra mile, etc. have always drawn attention. I stand out because I'm
using my network connection to it's fullest in an attempt to learn as much
as I can about computing. This makes people nervous. 

Joe Vasquez also said that my ethernet connection would probably be down
for *weeks*, until the next Network Advisory Committee meeting where this
issue would be discussed. This is NOT acceptable. I should not have to pay
for their paranoia and lack of foresight. 

Recently, I found that my dialup access had been suspended as well.  When
my ethernet was disconnected I began using my modem to connect to the
schools network just as I had always done. My friend and others continued
using my machine just as they had done for so long. I received an email on
my rohan account about the problem. It stated that my dialup privileges
were suspended because I let this person whose accounts were suspended
onto the SDSU network through my dialup. How is this possible? The dialups
are firewalled and there is only one phone line in my dorm room. 

The fact is, no one notified my friend that he should not be using the 
SDSU network and he continues to use his other accounts at this school.

I think it was probably illegal for them to tell me that this persons
accounts were suspended. In light of the Student Privacy Act school 
officials cannot release information about his personal records without 
his approval.

I do not want any more trouble. I will gladly remove his account upon 
request if that is what it takes to get my ethernet connection back. 

I intend to comply with all SDSU rules just as I always have. I have not
knowingly broken any of them. TNS should have better communicated their
concerns to me and I'm sure a solution could have been reached which would
have satisfied all parties involved.

It is not my intention to defend or degrade anyone in any way. However, I
felt it was necessary for me to write this letter. It does not appear that
there is anyone at TNS I can talk to about about this. I am going to have
to go to someone else with this. Perhaps the Ombudsmen. Some have
suggested taking it to the local papers.  So here I sit shelling out money
to an outside provider so I can do my computer work while a perfectly good
ethernet sits right here, disconnected for unjust reasons. I ask that my
ethernet be reconnected and everything returned to its previous state.

Tracy Reed,

Regarding your loss of dialup and ethernet connectivity, the SDSUnet
Security Policy has been followed to the letter.

I will issue a refund to you this week for the unused portion of your
Residence Halls network connection fee.

FYI, the dialup connections are NOT firewalled.

&gt;This friend of mine who was linked to forging email had always had an
&gt;account on my machine, almost since the very first time I connected my
&gt;UNIX machine to the schools network over the modem using ppp. He was using
&gt;my machine to read mail, newsgroups, etc. while one of his rohan accounts
&gt;was suspended. THIS is the reason my machine was disconnected. 
&gt;
&gt;Bob Clay said he did not want my friend on SDSU's network anymore but he
&gt;did not notify me of this until after my services were discontinued and as
&gt;far as I know my friend has never been notified of this. Infact, my friend
&gt;only recently recieved a letter from student affairs asking him to make an
&gt;appointment. 
&gt;
&gt;The proper thing for them to do if they did not want him on my machine is
&gt;to contact me and tell me not to allow him access. I would have gladly
&gt;complied if it meant keeping my ethernet. Instead they completely
&gt;disconnected me and were not completely honest with me about why I was
&gt;disconnected. When someone sends an offensive email from rohan, do they
&gt;pull the plug on rohan? No, they act properly and email the administrator
&gt;and have the account disabled. To this day, nobody has asked me to remove
&gt;his account. 
&gt;
&gt;Those of us who do things out of the ordinary, push the limits, go the
&gt;extra mile, etc. have always drawn attention. I stand out because I'm
&gt;using my network connection to it's fullest in an attempt to learn as much
&gt;as I can about computing. This makes people nervous. 
&gt;
&gt;Joe Vasquez also said that my ethernet connection would probably be down
&gt;for *weeks*, until the next Network Advisory Committee meeting where this
&gt;issue would be discussed. This is NOT acceptable. I should not have to pay
&gt;for their paranoia and lack of foresight. 
&gt;
&gt;Recently, I found that my dialup access had been suspended as well.  When
&gt;my ethernet was disconnected I began using my modem to connect to the
&gt;schools network just as I had always done. My friend and others continued
&gt;using my machine just as they had done for so long. I received an email on
&gt;my rohan account about the problem. It stated that my dialup privileges
&gt;were suspended because I let this person whose accounts were suspended
&gt;onto the SDSU network through my dialup. How is this possible? The dialups
&gt;are firewalled and there is only one phone line in my dorm room. 
&gt;
&gt;The fact is, no one notified my friend that he should not be using the 
&gt;SDSU network and he continues to use his other accounts at this school.
&gt; 
&gt;I think it was probably illegal for them to tell me that this persons
&gt;accounts were suspended. In light of the Student Privacy Act school 
&gt;officials cannot release information about his personal records without 
&gt;his approval.
&gt;
&gt;I do not want any more trouble. I will gladly remove his account upon 
&gt;request if that is what it takes to get my ethernet connection back. 
&gt;
&gt;I intend to comply with all SDSU rules just as I always have. I have not
&gt;knowingly broken any of them. TNS should have better communicated their
&gt;concerns to me and I'm sure a solution could have been reached which would
&gt;have satisfied all parties involved.
&gt;
&gt;It is not my intention to defend or degrade anyone in any way. However, I
&gt;felt it was necessary for me to write this letter. It does not appear that
&gt;there is anyone at TNS I can talk to about about this. I am going to have
&gt;to go to someone else with this. Perhaps the Ombudsmen. Some have
&gt;suggested taking it to the local papers.  So here I sit shelling out money
&gt;to an outside provider so I can do my computer work while a perfectly good
&gt;ethernet sits right here, disconnected for unjust reasons. I ask that my
&gt;ethernet be reconnected and everything returned to its previous state.

Can you believe that? I have no idea why I was told to speak with Vasquez. 
He obviously knows nothing about computing. He's just a beancounter for
the school. He asked me to show him some documentation that would show
what I had been using the machine for. I showed him a printout of the
password file, process list, etc. He just glanced at it and tossed it on
his desk. He didn't know what he was looking at most likely. Then he
rambled on about liability and made Jason Matthews out to be Satan
incarnate. He was completely useless.

Is this my official notification that my ethernet will NOT be

Ack. Sorry, my mistake. Didn't they used to be?

Tracy Reed:

The Housing Ethernet is part of SDSUnet.  Everything stated in the SDSUnet
Security Policy applies.

At this time I have no intention of reconnecting you unless we firewall the
residence halls from SDSUnet.

The dialups have never been firewalled as this precludes ARA and IPX.

As this matter is now in the hands of Judicial Procedures, there will be no
further correspondence from me to you on this subject.

This is something I had considered also, but decided not to mention it in

Ok, I'm almost afraid to ask: Why was my rohan account disabled?

The message says to contact judicial procedures. I did earlier today. 
Michael Car didn't sound too happy and told me wait until I received a
letter in the mail asking me to call. If this is their official policy,
you might want to change /bin/disabled to reflect this.

&gt; The dialups have never been firewalled as this precludes ARA and IPX.

This is at minimum another half truth. The dialups certainly do filter 
incoming IP traffic. I cannot believe you can sit there and deny this.

eg.
[it.is.my (jason)  |69| &gt; ftp 130.191.9.46
ftp: connect: Connection timed out

&gt; &gt;&gt; I will issue a refund to you this week for the unused portion of your

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Is this my official notification that my ethernet will NOT be

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; FYI, the dialup connections are NOT firewalled.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Ack. Sorry, my mistake. Didn't they used to be?

&gt; Ok, I'm almost afraid to ask: Why was my rohan account disabled?
&gt; 
&gt; The message says to contact judicial procedures. I did earlier today. 
&gt; Michael Car didn't sound too happy and told me wait until I received a
&gt; letter in the mail asking me to call. If this is their official policy,
&gt; you might want to change /bin/disabled to reflect this. 

Your account was disabled pending Judicial Procedures review of the case
where your dorm system provided Jason access.  I'll call Mike today and
see where this is going - if anywhere.  Mail and Rohan suspend accounts
togeather if there is a problem.  Bob's email to me on this was:

 Since Tracy's access has been suspended from other SDSUnet resources (Mail
 and the Dialups) I would appreciate it if you would suspend his named rohan
 account (treed) while Judicial Procedures reviews the case.  If he has any
 class accounts for school work these should remain enabled.

&gt; Hi Ron, 
&gt; 
&gt; why does Bob do this? Tracy and I obviously pose no clear and presesnt
&gt; danger to SDSU services, if rohan is not used in any illeged
&gt; incidents why does he feel he needs to close these accounts?. I do not
&gt; particularly care if he wants to order his little world in the tns office
&gt; but why is he allowed flex his muscles around campus like this? 
&gt; 
&gt; humbly,
&gt; Jason

It is not for me to comment.  In general, I am obligated to follow the
NAC guidelines.  When Bob feels the guidelines have been violated, I go by his
opinion.  The NAC sets up the guidelines we use to set policy.

Now my rohan account is back up! What happened? I didn't do anything!
Maybe my ethernet will mysteriously be reconnected as well!

I called Mike Hoctor. He said that he has read the emails and is aware of the 
problem but they are in the middle of getting some other dorms wired and
now would be an awkward time for him to do anything. He told me to call
Sharon Edwards. I did and she was not in, but I left a message for her.

I am extremely unhappy with this whole situation. I am being treated very
unfairly by TNS and nobody in the administration seems to give a flying
fig.  Clay keeps pestering me to come pick up my ethernet refund. I won't
be discriminated against because of my choice of hardware, software, or
friends.  Everyone is too afraid for their jobs or current pet projects to
cause a stir. So, can you tell me (without incurring the wrath of Bob, who
appears to have everyone by the short and curlies these days), what must I
do to get my rohan account activated? Why is it still on hold? I talked to
Judicial Procedures and they blew me off. I still haven't even received a
letter from them. Now what?!?! There are projects I want to work on and I 
cannot work on them.

Subject: Ethernet


They have now mailed me a refund check. This is completely unacceptable. 
I am very disappointed in the lack of support or even consideration from
adminstration. I must arrange for a personal meeting with you as soon as
possible. I will be arriving in San Diego on Jan. 3rd. I am in San Antonio
at the moment visiting family. Housing owns this equipment and can dictate
the policy for it. I have consulted many people and everyone (outside of
TNS, that is) has told me that I have a very good case and that I have
been treated unfairly. Even complete strangers who I have emailed all of
the emails exchanged over this agree with me. How can they refund my money
without even consulting housing? Did you tell them they could do this? As
you are aware, I have been looking forward to this for a long time and I
even made special arrangements to get into a dorm with ethernet and I even
paid extra money (zura single as opposed to super single) to be able to
have ethernet. I do not understand how the ethernet in the dorms project
can go forward as long as these issues are unresolved. Who knows how many
other students on ethernet are running multiuser machines. That is the
main reason for getting ether as fair as I am concerned. Many other
schools allow this, it's not without precedent and many schools have
policies to cover it properly, unlike SDSU.  However, disconnecting
someones ethernet connection without consulting the person and attempting
to resolve the problem and then refusing that person any service in the
future is completely unprecented as far as I am aware. I wish there was
SOMONE at this school I could talk to who knew something about networking.
Unfortunately, all computer problems are referred to TNS, but they are the
problem. Just in case this does not work out in the next few weeks, I am
exploring other options which include legal procedures and local papers. I
know I can get articles printed in the Union Tribune and Daily Aztec
exposing this mistreatment. Small claims court may be an option, even
though I am not seeking money. This is more of a discrimination and breach
of contract case. I will try to keep housing out of it wherever possible
since the problem is really with TNS.

And so here I sit. No ether. Lots of wasted time and money. And a school
which doesn't seem to care. :(
